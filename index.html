		<ul>
			<li><p>Since we can't use the bigger and less symbols, and "&" cause they conflict with the semantic of HTML, we use the tags "&lt" and "&gt", and "&amp", adding a ";" at the end, here's an example: "5 is &gp; then 3, &amp; 3 is &lt; 5"</p></li>

			<li><p>To use the copyright symbol, use the tag "& copy (without the space)" and a ";" at the end, to see the example,check the footer of the page</p></li>

			<li><p>Whes we want a part of the text, like two words that cant be separated, to stick together, we use the tag "& nbsp" between the words that we want to stick together (without the space, and with an ";" at the end)</p></li>

			<li><p>There is also a way to use " ", using a HTML Tag, the tag "& quot" (without the space and with an ";" at the end), creates a " (only one, so use it at the beggining of the sentence and at the end)</p></li>

			<li><p>To add a link that's inside the same directory that the HTML is located, into the page, we use the tag "a", and we add an atribute to the tag "a", called "href" (wich means "hypertext reference"), and inside the atribute we copy the link adress. And also, we can add the atribute "title" to the "a" tag, so that when we keep the cursor over the link, we have a little text about what the link is about, example: <a href="same_dir_html_file.html" title="Here's the subject inside the atribute called title">Here we have the text, that when we click it, we're gonna be sent to the link added here</a>. And here we se an example to an external link: <a href="https://github.com/SamuelDAlencar/practice-site" target="_blank" title="Here's the subject inside the atribute called title">And in adition to that, we can use the atribute "target="_blank"" to make the link clicked by the client, open in another window, so that the client doesn't leave the main web site</a></p></li>

			<li><p>Yet inside the link subject of the lecture, we can add a DIV element inside the "a" tag, so that we can click in a whole area, a whole block, like a company logo, and get to the specified link, example: <a href="same_dir_html_file.html" title="Here's the subject inside the atribute called title"><div>That's a block, that has an whole clickable area to get to the added link (can be edited and modified for a bigger range using css)</div></a></p></li><br>

			<hr>

			<br><li><p>To implemnt images to the page, we use the tag "img", and we can add images from the same directory where the index file came from, and also from the web. <br><br><br><p id="me_block">Here's an example of a file from the same directory as the HTML file: <img id="me" src="Me 12.jpg" width="500px"></p> <p id="levi_block">Now here's the example of a file from the web: <img id="levi" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Jordan_Peterson_June_2018.jpg/800px-Jordan_Peterson_June_2018.jpg" width="380px"></p></p></li><br>

			<br><li><p>We can create a part of the web page to help the client navigate through the sections and content displayed on the page, there'll be a whole large example in latim about this at the end of the page, use this section to get there and test the functionality:</p></li>

    	<h3>1 - Who's Jordan?.</h3>
    	<p class="undersections"></p>
    	<p>Jordan Bernt Peterson (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist, and YouTube personality. He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his conservative views on cultural and political issues.

		Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University. After teaching and research at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.

		In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing the Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce "gender identity and expression" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. He argued that the bill would make the use of certain gender pronouns into compelled speech, and related this argument to a general critique of political correctness and identity politics. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.

		Peterson's lectures and debates—propagated also through podcasts and YouTube—gradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Promoted with a world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries. In 2021, Peterson published his third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life.</p>

  		<h3>2 - Early life.</h3>
  		<p class="undersections" style="left: 54px;"></p>
    	<p>Peterson was born on 12 June 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta, and grew up in Fairview, a small town in the northwest of the province. He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher. His middle name is Bernt (/ˈbɛərənt/, BAIR-ənt), after his Norwegian great-grandfather.

		In junior high school, Peterson became friends with Rachel Notley and her family. Notley became leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th premier of Alberta. Peterson joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) from ages 13 to 18.</p>

    	<h3>3 - Education.</h3>
    	<p class="undersections" style="left: 65px;"></p>
    	<p>After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature, studying to be a corporate lawyer. During this time he read Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell which significantly affected his educational focus and worldview. He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982. Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe, where he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War; 20th-century European totalitarianism; and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier. While at McGill University and the Douglas Hospital, he conducted research into familial alcoholism and its associated psychopathologies, such as childhood and adolescent aggression and hyperactive behavior.</p>

    	<p>From July 1993 to June 1998, Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University, where he was hired as an assistant professor in the psychology department, later becoming an associate professor. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and showed great readiness to take on research projects, even unconventional ones. Still while there, he switched his primary area of research from familial alcoholism to personality. After the change of focus, he has published extensively. Two former PhD students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz, recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students. He returned to Canada in July 1998 and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.

		Peterson's areas of study and research within the fields of psychology are psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational, religious, ideological, political, and creativity. Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and was cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017; at end of 2020 almost 15,000 times.

		Beginning 2003, Peterson has been sought by various mainstream and international TV productions for commentary on a wide range of subjects, from a personal- and social-psychological perspective. He was invited by Wodek Szemberg for appearances on Big Ideas in Canada as a lecturer. A TV mini-series based on Maps of Meaning was aired on TVOntario in 2004. In 2007, BBC Horizon produced Mad but Glad, focussing on pianist Nick van Bloss; van Bloss met Peterson, who provided insights as a clinician and researcher with expertise on low-latent inhibition. From 2011, TVOntario's The Agenda has featured Peterson as an essayist and panelist on psychologically relevant cultural issues.

		For most of his career, Peterson maintained a clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He has been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16. As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017 and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018. In February 2018, Peterson entered into a promise with the College of Psychologists of Ontario after a professional misconduct complaint about his communication and the boundaries he sets with his patients. The College did not consider a full disciplinary hearing necessary and accepted Peterson entering into a three-month undertaking to work on prioritizing his practice and improving his patient communications. Peterson had no prior disciplinary punishments or restrictions on his clinical practice.

		Regarding the topic of religion and God, Bret Weinstein moderated a debate between Peterson and Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver in June 2018. In July, the two debated the subject again, this time moderated by Douglas Murray, at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London. In April 2019, Peterson debated Slavoj Žižek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.</p>

    	<p>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999)
		Main article: Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief
		In 1999, Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, in which Peterson describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs, and make narratives. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, draws concepts from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and psychology, in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.


		Peterson at the University of Toronto in March 2017
		According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why individuals and groups alike participate in social conflict, exploring the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification) that eventually result in killing and pathological atrocities such as the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp, and the Rwandan genocide. Influenced by Jung's archetypal view of the collective unconscious in the book, Peterson says that an "analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality."

		In 2004, a 13-part TV miniseries based on Peterson's book aired on TVOntario.

		12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018)
		Main article: 12 Rules for Life
		In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, in which abstract ethical principles about life are provided in a more accessible style than his previous Maps of Meaning.[29][49][63] The book topped best-selling lists in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom.[64][65][66]

		To promote the book, Peterson embarked on a world tour.[67]

		Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life (2021)
		Main article: Beyond Order
		Peterson's third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, was released on 2 March 2021.[68] On 23 November 2020, his publisher Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) held an internal town hall where many employees criticized the decision to publish the book.[69]</p>

  	<h1>Lecture's Summary: Week 2.</h1>

  	<p id="underh1"></p>

  	<p>Anatomy of a css rule: consists of: 
  		<ol>
  			<li>Selector: "p", "h1", "ul", "footer"</li>
  			<li>Property: "color", "font-style", "font-size"</li>
  			<li>Declaration: ":", ";"</li>
  			<li>Value: "30px", "green", "center"</li>
  		</ol>

  		<p>And everything together makes a "Stylesheet"</p>

  		<p>Here are three Selectors we can use in to modify elements with css:
  			<ul>
  				<li>element Selector: ("p", "h1", "section") affects all elements (that specific selected one)</li>
  				<li>class Selector (class=""): affects only the element attributed with that specific class Selector (uses "." to define it)</li>
  				<li>id Selector (id=""): affects only the element attributed with that specific id Selector (uses "#" to define it)</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p><br>

  		<p>We can also group selectors, exemple: "div, .div1, #block98 {}", or mix selectors, which can probably be needed when we have the same id or class for two diferent elements, exemple: "div.block {}", and "p#text {}"</p>

  		<p>Child Selector: we can use the parent and child relation to make the selection, so that when we want to affect a child, but only in one specific element, like in this example: "div > p {}", in this example, all "p" inside the divs would be affected (only works when the child is a direct child to the parent)</p>

  		<p>Descendent Selector: still with the same principle as the child selector, we can use the same relation, but without having to be a direct child to work, by just removing the ">", example: "article p {}" in this example, "p" is gonna be affected even if it is not a direct child to "article"</p>
  			
  	</p><br>

  	<p>Pseudo-classes: they allow us to change the style of elements depending on it's state or action made on it, for example, if I want to change the style of a link when I hover it, or click it, we use "a:hover {}", like here: <a id="linkedin"href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-de-alencar-972896203/" title="My Linkedin" target="_blank">My Linkedin</a>. The "nth-child()" allows us to target an specific child from the element we're changing, for example, if there's 3 links in a header, we can target the second one by using "header:nth-child(2) {}". We can also combine pseudo-selectors, like when we want to target the action of an especific link, we would use: "header:nth-child(2):hover {}"</p><br>

  	<hr>

  	<br><p>We can specify styles for our HTML page in three ways:
		<ul>
			<li>Adding a style atribute to the element, a in-line styling (style="")</li>
			<li>Adding the "style" section to the head of your HTML page ("&lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;")</li>
			<li>Creating an external CSS file, and linkin it to your HTML page (&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=" "&gt;)</li>
		</ul> 

  	</p><br>

  	<p>Since we have multiple ways to implement CSS into our web page, there may be some conflicts on the way, so to avoid those conflicts, we should consider some rules:

  		<ol><li>Origin precedence (when not confllict).</li>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Last declaration wins: Remember, HTML is processed sequentially, top to bottom, and for precedence, think of external CSS as declared at the spot where it's linked to.</li>
  				<li>Declarations Merge</li>
  			</ul>
  			<li>Inheritance</li>
  			<ul>
  				<li>DOM Tree: if we specify a property directly in a parent element, without specifying on a specific child of that parent, that child, and every element bellow that parent, will be affected by that property, for exemple, if we only specify "background-color: red;" in the body part, every last part of the web page will have a red background color, unless we specify a background color for an specific child of that parent.</li>
  			</ul>
  			<li>Specificity</li>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Most specific Selector Combination Wins: to help us identify wich ones are more specific than the other, we can use a simple technique: the most specific and direct you are in a selector, ahead that selector will be from other selectors that has to many atributes and not so targeting, example: "body h2 {color: green;}" it's not that specific and targeted than that example, that's directly changed in the element, and also has an ID: "&lt;h2 id="h2color" style="color: blue;"&gt;", so that h2 is going to be blue</li>
  			</ul>
  		</ol>
  	</p><br>

  	<hr>

  	<br><ul><li>There are 2 units of measure for fonts, that are relative, Percent, and ems.</li>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Percent: when we specify our font size using percentage, it makes the text fit the percentage we specified, according to the web browser's default sizing</li>
  			<li>ems: This measure multiplies the default size of your element, but if you change the size of a div for example, using css, and make it 120%, if this element has any childs, and we make it 2em, it's size will be tiwce the before size, wich was 120%, for example:</li><br>
  				<div style="font-size: 2em">This text is 40px large, because my preset size was 20px and now i made it 2em <br><br><div style="font-size: .5em">We can also lower its size using ems, just by adding a "." before it, for example, this text, but since that text is a child of the text i just magnified, to lower it by 2ems, i have to use ".5em", because if i use 2em, i'll only return it's size to my regular 20px since that text is a parent, and is already 2em, affecting it's childs. So, here is an example of a text lowered 2ems (without previous magnifying)</div></div><br> <div style="font-size: .4em">This text is .4ems (from 20px)</div>
  		</ul>
  	</ul>

  	<p>When we specify a color, we can use "red", "blue", going for the more common ways to get a color, or we can use a hexadecimal value for a specific color (wich is the most used method) using, for example, for the same Blue color, we can use "color: blue;" or "color: #000ff;"</p>

  	<hr>

	<p>Box Models: talking about box models, we can use a feel examples, now, here's a div with some random content, inside another div</p>

	<div id="box1">
		<div id="content1">
			That's the box
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>If we take a closer look, we can see that there's a small gap between both sides of the div, so to understand what's going on, we open Inspect Element, and what we see is 4 parts of our HTML page body, a margin, a border, a padding and the content, but remember, that depends on the browser and it's default settings</p> 

	<p>Now we're gonna add the padding and margin to our div, and change it's atributes</p>	

	<div id="box2">
		<div id="content2">
			That's the box
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>By default, the box sizing is set to content box, so when we specify its height and width, we're specifiyng the content's height and width, not the entire thing. There's also a way to specify the box size, by using "box-sizing", so then we can use the border's size, or the content's size. But all of the modern frameworks, like bootstrap, uses border-box as it's sizing model</p>

	<p>The "*" element, selects every single element of the page, and applies the properties you define to it</p>

	<p>Cumulative Margins: imagine that we have two boxes, side by side, and the left box's margin is 40px, and the right one is 50px, the total margin between those two boxes is gonna be 90px, because they're comulative, but what happens if we have a element on top of other element, two divs, and each one specifies a margin, for example 30px and 20px, in that case, it's total margin's gonna be 30px, cause in that case, it is not comulative, in that case the biggest margin will be set</p>

	<p>When we specify sizes for our content inside the box, but we exceed it's size, and it ends up getting a overflow, like this:</p>

	<div id="box3">
		<div id="content3">
			Evangelion is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The protagonist is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his father Gendo to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha named "Evangelion" into combat against beings called "Angels"
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>That's the overflow, so to fix this, we can use some overflow options, for example "overflow: auto;", wich will ad scroll bars when needed, so we can scroll and keep reading the content</p><br>

	<p>We can specify a background image by using the css tag "background-image: url ("")", for example:</p><br>

	<div id="jdp" style="background-color: #090c10">Durante um evento na Cambridge Union Society, em novembro de 2018, Zizek disse que o trabalho de Peterson era pseudocientífico, classificou-o como seu inimigo e criticou as visões de Peterson quando ao marxismo cultural. Peterson disse que poderia encontrá-lo "a qualquer hora e em qualquer lugar" para debater e então o encontro foi anunciado para o dia 28 de fevereiro de 2019, posteriormente mudado para o dia 19 de abril.</div><br>

	<p>When we specify a size for the image, but it's too large, the image will repeat it self inside the box, so to avoid this we can use the atribute "background-repeat: no-repeat;", or if we want to specify the side, we use "background-repeat: repeat-x;"</p>

	<p>If we want to specify the place of the box that we want the image, we add the position after the url</p><br>

	<hr>

	<br><p>Position elements by floating: the "float" atribute makes an element float all the way to the side that we specify, for example: "#p1 {float-right}". Using this line, we'll make the first paragraph box position itself to the right, like here:</p>

	<div id="pbox">
  		<p id="p1"></p>
  		<p id="p2"></p>
  		<p id="p3"></p>
  		<p id="p4"></p>
  		<section id="psection">This is regular content continuing after the the paragraph boxes.</section>
	</div>

	<p>When we float a element from its regular document flow flow, the other elements placed on that flow will reposition themselves, since we got the first paragraph out from its regular flow. If it happens to colapse, and the text inside the div didn't position it self properly, like this:</p>

	<div id="pbox2">
  		<p id="p1b"></p>
  		<p id="p2b"></p>
  		<p id="p3b"></p>
  		<p id="p4b"></p>
  		<section id="psection2">This is regular content continuing after the the paragraph boxes.</section>
	</div>

	<p>We use the "clear" property, wich tells the browser not to flow any element to the specified side, but since we already floated the paragraphs to the left size, it'll ending up correcting the text's position:</p>

	<div id="pbox3">
  		<p id="p1c"></p>
  		<p id="p2c"></p>
  		<p id="p3c"></p>
  		<p id="p4c"></p>
  		<section id="psection3">This is regular content continuing after the the paragraph boxes.</section>
	</div><br>

	<p>We can also use "clear-both" to clear both sides, and correct any conflicts</p>

	<hr>

	<p>To create two columns, we can use the "float" property, but with some changes, for example, to create two columns, we can float one of them to the left, and the other to the right, but to make it responsive to the size of the client's screen, and make it stick with the two columns layout even when we change the browser's size, we can set the size of our elements using "%" instead of "px", for example:</p>

	<div id="anime">
		<p id="snk">Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. "The Attack Titan") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity lives inside cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from the gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after a Titan brings about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. Attack on Titan has been serialized in Kodansha's monthly Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine since September 2009 and collected into 33 tankōbon volumes as of January 2021.</p>
		<p id="eva">Evangelion is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3. The protagonist is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his father Gendo to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha named "Evangelion" into combat against beings called "Angels". The series explores the experiences and emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv as they try to prevent Angels from causing more cataclysms. In the process, they are called upon to understand the ultimate causes of events and the motives for human action.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Using "%", and "float", we made two responsive columns</p><br>

	<br><p>Relative and Absolute Element Positioning</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Element is positioned relative to its position in normal document flow</li>
				<li>Positioning CSS (offset) properties are: top, bottom, left, right</li>
				<li>Element is NOT taken out of normal document flow, and even if it is moved, its original is preserved</li>
			</ul>

		<li>Absolute positioning</li>
			<ul>
				<li>All ofsets (top, bottom, left, right) are relative to the position of the nearest ancestor wich has positioning set on it, other than static</li>
				<li>By default, HTML is the only element that has non-static positioning set on it (relative)</li>
				<li>Element is taken out of normal document flow</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Now here's examples of absolute positioning, and relative positioning, reutilizing the paragraphs example from before</p>

	<div id="pboxd">
  		<p id="p1d"></p>
  		<p id="p2d"></p>
  		<p id="p3d"></p>
  		<p id="p4d"></p>
	</div>

	<p>Here we moved the first paragraph, using pixels to define the distance from the corner wich the box is located. And we also moved the third paragraph, but now, using the absolute positioning, but something happened, because the paragraph is no longer inside the div, in fact, it is all the way up in our browser (i left the paragraph comented so that it doesn't interfere the look), and that's because absolute positioning needs a relative or an absolute parent or ancestor, so since the paragraph, so, to fix this, we just have to anchor its ancestor, so that the paragraph has the reference to hold on to, and to to this we can set the div, wich has the paragraph inside it, a relative position, like here:</p>

	<div id="pboxe">
  		<p id="p1e"></p>
  		<p id="p2e"></p>
  		<p id="p3e"></p>
  		<p id="p4e"></p>
	</div><br>

	<br><p>Media Queries: to make our webpage a responsive web page to any device, we'll make use of Media Queries, that basically sets a limit, that when reached, it'll define a new atribute, for example, those two paragraphs, let's make them responsive to large screen devices, when the screen reaches 1200px width, the first paragraphs's width will change to 80%, and the second paragraph will change it's width and height to 150px. We're also going to make it responsive to medium devices, so let's make it lower a litle bit the paragraphs size when the page gets between 992px and 1199px (1199px so that it doesn't conflict with the previous media we set)</p>

	<p id="pmq"></p>
	<p id="pmq2"></p>

	<p>You can see that above 1200px, the first paragraph changed it's width to 80%, and the second paragraph changed it's width and height to 150px, and when the page get's between 992px and 1199px, the first paragraph changes it's width to 50%, and the second paragraph changes it's height and width to 100px</p>

	<p>To help us vizualize better those changes and how they work, we can use our browser's dev tools (inspect element)</p><br>

	<p>Responsive Web Site: a Responsive web site is designed to adapt its layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and css3 media queries, so that the site's layout adapts to the size of the device, but having in mind that the content verbosity, or its visual delivery may change</p>

	<p>To make it more easy to understand, lets use the 12 grid layout on the page to make this example, Here we have 8 blocks, and they're all responsive to large and medium sized screens, , using a simple and responsive framework. When the screen gets between 950px and 1199px, it'll change from a four column layout, to a two column layout, and below that, a single column layout responsive to the screen size we set, or the mobile we're using. But for it to work inside mobile phones, we have to use a meta tag called "viewport", and make it's width to be the device's width, and then remove the automatic mobile zooming, and make the page fit the mobile correctly </p>

	<div class="row">
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr1">Item 1</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr2">Item 2</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr3">Item 3</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr4">Item 4</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr5">Item 5</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr6">Item 6</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr7">Item 7</p></div>
  		<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6"><p id="pr8">Item 8</p></div>
	</div><br>

	<br><p>Bootstrap: bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web</p>

	<ul>but Bootstrap may have some disadvantages:
		<li>Disadvantages
			<ul>
				<li>Too big, too bloated</li>
				<li>Some features we'll barely use, for example the Selective Download feature</li>
				<li>You can write your own that's more targeted/smaller, but of course it'll take much more time to write it as well</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>And since a framework is the skeleton of the text, and we inserted bootstrap in that page (that has already been entirely modified), some parts of the text may not be properly positioned inside the page</p>

	<p>Bootstrap Grid System: These are the components of the grid system</p>

	<ul>
		<li>class="container" (or container fluid, that streches your layout to full width of the browser, and provides consistent padding around your grid, and other content): has predetermined fixed width, but still responsive based on the width of the browser (your bootstrap grid must always be inside a container)</li>
		<li>class="row" (inside the container): Creates horizontal groups of columns, that can also apply negative left/right margins</li>
		<li>class="col-md-4" (inside the row): Columns that forms the grid</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Every Bootstrap column class is defined using this template: col-SIZE-SPAN</p>

	<ul>
		<li>SIZE:
			<ul>
				<li>Screen width range identifier</li>
				<li>Columns will collapse (i.e.,stack) below that width, UNLESS another rule applies</li>
			</ul>
		</li>

		<li>SPAN:
			<ul>
				<li>How many columns element should span</li>
				<li>Values: 1 through 12</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Now here's an example of three columns, and how we use bootstrap to organize and choose how we want them to be. When we strech the browser to a certain point, depending on wich grids we want the column to take, it'll change to the size we specified</p>

	<div style= "color: black" class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Column 1</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Column 2</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Column 3</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div style= "color: black" class="container-fluid">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Column 1</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Column 2</div>
			<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Column 3</div>
		</div>
	</div><br>
