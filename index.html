			<li><p>Since we can't use the bigger and less symbols, and "&" cause they conflict with the semantic of HTML, we use the tags "&lt" and "&gt", and "&amp", adding a ";" at the end, here's an example: "5 is &gp; then 3, &amp; 3 is &lt; 5"</p></li>

			<li><p>To use the copyright symbol, use the tag "& copy (without the space)" and a ";" at the end, to see the example,check the footer of the page</p></li>

			<li><p>Whes we want a part of the text, like two words that cant be separated, to stick together, we use the tag "& nbsp" between the words that we want to stick together (without the space, and with an ";" at the end)</p></li>

			<li><p>There is also a way to use " ", using a HTML Tag, the tag "& quot" (without the space and with an ";" at the end), creates a " (only one, so use it at the beggining of the sentence and at the end)</p></li>

			<li><p>To add a link that's inside the same directory that the HTML is located, into the page, we use the tag "a", and we add an atribute to the tag "a", called "href" (wich means "hypertext reference"), and inside the atribute we copy the link adress. And also, we can add the atribute "title" to the "a" tag, so that when we keep the cursor over the link, we have a little text about what the link is about, example: <a href="same_dir_html_file.html" title="Here's the subject inside the atribute called title">Here we have the text, that when we click it, we're gonna be sent to the link added here</a>. And here we se an example to an external link: <a href="https://github.com/SamuelDAlencar/practice-site" target="_blank" title="Here's the subject inside the atribute called title">And in adition to that, we can use the atribute "target="_blank"" to make the link clicked by the client, open in another window, so that the client doesn't leave the main web site</a></p></li>

			<li><p>Yet inside the link subject of the lecture, we can add a DIV element inside the "a" tag, so that we can click in a whole area, a whole block, like a company logo, and get to the specified link, example: <a href="same_dir_html_file.html" title="Here's the subject inside the atribute called title"><div>That's a block, that has an whole clickable area to get to the added link (can be edited and modified for a bigger range using css)</div></a></p></li>

			<hr>

			<li><p>To implemnt images to the page, we use the tag "img", and we can add images from the same directory where the index file came from, and also from the web. <br><br><br><p id="me_block">Here's an example of a file from the same directory as the HTML file: <img id="me" src="Me 12.jpg" width="500px"></p> <p id="levi_block">Now here's the example of a file from the web: <img id="levi" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Jordan_Peterson_June_2018.jpg/800px-Jordan_Peterson_June_2018.jpg" width="380px"></p></p></li><br><br><br>

			<hr>

			<br><li><p>We can create a part of the web page to help the client navigate through the sections and content displayed on the page, there'll be a whole large example in latim about this at the end of the page, use this section to get there and test the functionality:</p></li>

    	<h3>(#section1) Who's Jordan?</h3>
    	<p>Jordan Bernt Peterson (born 12 June 1962) is a Canadian professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist, and YouTube personality. He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his conservative views on cultural and political issues.

		Born and raised in Alberta, Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a PhD in clinical psychology from McGill University. After teaching and research at Harvard University, he returned to Canada in 1998 to join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and meaning.

		In 2016, Peterson released a series of YouTube videos criticizing the Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code (Bill C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce "gender identity and expression" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. He argued that the bill would make the use of certain gender pronouns into compelled speech, and related this argument to a general critique of political correctness and identity politics. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.

		Peterson's lectures and debates—propagated also through podcasts and YouTube—gradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos. Promoted with a world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries. In 2021, Peterson published his third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life.</p>

  		<h3>(#section2) Early life</h3>
    	<p>Peterson was born on 12 June 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta, and grew up in Fairview, a small town in the northwest of the province. He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher. His middle name is Bernt (/ˈbɛərənt/, BAIR-ənt), after his Norwegian great-grandfather.

		In junior high school, Peterson became friends with Rachel Notley and her family. Notley became leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party and 17th premier of Alberta. Peterson joined the New Democratic Party (NDP) from ages 13 to 18.</p>

    	<h3>(#section3) Education</h3>
    	<p>After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science and English literature, studying to be a corporate lawyer. During this time he read Road to Wigan Pier by George Orwell which significantly affected his educational focus and worldview. He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in political science in 1982. Afterwards, he took a year off to visit Europe, where he began studying the psychological origins of the Cold War; 20th-century European totalitarianism; and the works of Carl Jung, Friedrich Nietzsche, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. He then returned to the University of Alberta and received a B.A. in psychology in 1984. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl in 1991, and remained as a post-doctoral fellow at McGill's Douglas Hospital until June 1993, working with Pihl and Maurice Dongier. While at McGill University and the Douglas Hospital, he conducted research into familial alcoholism and its associated psychopathologies, such as childhood and adolescent aggression and hyperactive behavior.</p>

    	<h2>(#section4) Career</h2>

    	<img id="jordan2"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/Peterson_Lecture_%2833522701146%29.png/800px-Peterson_Lecture_%2833522701146%29.png" width="300px">

    	<p>From July 1993 to June 1998, Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University, where he was hired as an assistant professor in the psychology department, later becoming an associate professor. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse and showed great readiness to take on research projects, even unconventional ones. Still while there, he switched his primary area of research from familial alcoholism to personality. After the change of focus, he has published extensively. Two former PhD students, Shelley Carson, a psychologist and teacher from Harvard, and author Gregg Hurwitz, recalled that Peterson's lectures were already highly admired by the students. He returned to Canada in July 1998 and eventually became a full professor at the University of Toronto.

		Peterson's areas of study and research within the fields of psychology are psychopharmacology, abnormal, neuro, clinical, personality, social, industrial and organizational, religious, ideological, political, and creativity. Peterson has authored or co-authored more than a hundred academic papers and was cited almost 8,000 times as of mid-2017; at end of 2020 almost 15,000 times.

		Beginning 2003, Peterson has been sought by various mainstream and international TV productions for commentary on a wide range of subjects, from a personal- and social-psychological perspective. He was invited by Wodek Szemberg for appearances on Big Ideas in Canada as a lecturer. A TV mini-series based on Maps of Meaning was aired on TVOntario in 2004. In 2007, BBC Horizon produced Mad but Glad, focussing on pianist Nick van Bloss; van Bloss met Peterson, who provided insights as a clinician and researcher with expertise on low-latent inhibition. From 2011, TVOntario's The Agenda has featured Peterson as an essayist and panelist on psychologically relevant cultural issues.

		For most of his career, Peterson maintained a clinical practice, seeing about 20 people a week. He has been active on social media, and in September 2016 he released a series of videos in which he criticized Bill C-16. As a result of new projects, he decided to put the clinical practice on hold in 2017 and temporarily stopped teaching as of 2018. In February 2018, Peterson entered into a promise with the College of Psychologists of Ontario after a professional misconduct complaint about his communication and the boundaries he sets with his patients. The College did not consider a full disciplinary hearing necessary and accepted Peterson entering into a three-month undertaking to work on prioritizing his practice and improving his patient communications. Peterson had no prior disciplinary punishments or restrictions on his clinical practice.

		Regarding the topic of religion and God, Bret Weinstein moderated a debate between Peterson and Sam Harris at the Orpheum Theatre in Vancouver in June 2018. In July, the two debated the subject again, this time moderated by Douglas Murray, at the 3Arena in Dublin and The O2 Arena in London. In April 2019, Peterson debated Slavoj Žižek at the Sony Centre in Toronto over happiness under capitalism versus Marxism.</p>

    	<p>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999)
		Main article: Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief
		In 1999, Routledge published Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, in which Peterson describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs, and make narratives. The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, draws concepts from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and psychology, in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.


		Peterson at the University of Toronto in March 2017
		According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why individuals and groups alike participate in social conflict, exploring the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification) that eventually result in killing and pathological atrocities such as the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp, and the Rwandan genocide. Influenced by Jung's archetypal view of the collective unconscious in the book, Peterson says that an "analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality."

		In 2004, a 13-part TV miniseries based on Peterson's book aired on TVOntario.

		12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018)
		Main article: 12 Rules for Life
		In January 2018, Penguin Random House published Peterson's second book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, in which abstract ethical principles about life are provided in a more accessible style than his previous Maps of Meaning.[29][49][63] The book topped best-selling lists in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the US, and the United Kingdom.[64][65][66]

		To promote the book, Peterson embarked on a world tour.[67]

		Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life (2021)
		Main article: Beyond Order
		Peterson's third book, Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, was released on 2 March 2021.[68] On 23 November 2020, his publisher Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) held an internal town hall where many employees criticized the decision to publish the book.[69]</p>

  	<br><h1>Lecture's Summary: Week 2</h1><br><br>

  	<p>Anatomy of a css rule: consists of: 
  		<ol>
  			<li>Selector: "p", "h1", "ul", "footer"</li>
  			<li>Property: "color", "font-style", "font-size"</li>
  			<li>Declaration: ":", ";"</li>
  			<li>Value: "30px", "green", "center"</li>
  		</ol>

  		<p>And everything together makes a "Stylesheet"</p>

  		<p>Here are three Selectors we can use in to modify elements with css:
  			<ul>
  				<li>element Selector: ("p", "h1", "section") affects all elements (that specific selected one)</li>
  				<li>class Selector (class=""): affects only the element attributed with that specific class Selector (uses "." to define it)</li>
  				<li>id Selector (id=""): affects only the element attributed with that specific id Selector (uses "#" to define it)</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p><br>

  		<p>We can also group selectors, exemple: "div, .div1, #block98 {}", or mix selectors, which can probably be needed when we have the same id or class for two diferent elements, exemple: "div.block {}", and "p#text {}"</p>

  		<p>Child Selector: we can use the parent and child relation to make the selection, so that when we want to affect a child, but only in one specific element, like in this example: "div > p {}", in this example, all "p" inside the divs would be affected (only works when the child is a direct child to the parent)</p>

  		<p>Descendent Selector: still with the same principle as the child selector, we can use the same relation, but without having to be a direct child to work, by just removing the ">", example: "article p {}" in this example, "p" is gonna be affected even if it is not a direct child to "article"</p>
  			
  	</p><br>

  	<p>Pseudo-classes: they allow us to change the style of elements depending on it's state or action made on it, for example, if I want to change the style of a link when I hover it, or click it, we use "a:hover {}", like here: <a id="linkedin"href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-de-alencar-972896203/" title="My Linkedin" target="_blank">My Linkedin</a>. The "nth-child()" allows us to target an specific child from the element we're changing, for example, if there's 3 links in a header, we can target the second one by using "header:nth-child(2) {}". We can also combine pseudo-selectors, like when we want to target the action of an especific link, we would use: "header:nth-child(2):hover {}"</p><br>

  	<p>We can specify styles for our HTML page in three ways:
		<ul>
			<li>Adding a style atribute to the element, a in-line styling (style="")</li>
			<li>Adding the "style" section to the head of your HTML page ("&lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt;")</li>
			<li>Creating an external CSS file, and linkin it to your HTML page (&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href=" "&gt;)</li>
		</ul> 

  	</p><br>

  	<p>Since we have multiple ways to implement CSS into our web page, there may be some conflicts on the way, so to avoid those conflicts, we should consider some rules:

  		<ol><li>Origin precedence (when not confllict).</li>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Last declaration wins: Remember, HTML is processed sequentially, top to bottom, and for precedence, think of external CSS as declared at the spot where it's linked to.</li>
  				<li>Declarations Merge</li>
  			</ul>
  			<li>Inheritance</li>
  			<ul>
  				<li>DOM Tree: if we specify a property directly in a parent element, without specifying on a specific child of that parent, that child, and every element bellow that parent, will be affected by that property, for exemple, if we only specify "background-color: red;" in the body part, every last part of the web page will have a red background color, unless we specify a background color for an specific child of that parent.</li>
  			</ul>
  			<li>Specificity</li>
  			<ul>
  				<li>Most specific Selector Combination Wins: to help us identify wich ones are more specific than the other, we can use a simple technique: the most specific and direct you are in a selector, ahead that selector will be from other selectors that has to many atributes and not so targeting, example: "body h2 {color: green;}" it's not that specific and targeted than that example, that's directly changed in the element, and also has an ID: "&lt;h2 id="h2color" style="color: blue;"&gt;", so that h2 is going to be blue</li>
  			</ul>
  		</ol>
  	</p><br><br>

  	<ul><li>There are 2 units of measure for fonts, that are relative, Percent, and ems.</li>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Percent: when we specify our font size using percentage, it makes the text fit the percentage we specified, according to the web browser's default sizing</li>
  			<li>ems: This measure multiplies the default size of your element, but if you change the size of a div for example, using css, and make it 120%, if this element has any childs, and we make it 2em, it's size will be tiwce the before size, wich was 120%, for example:</li><br>
  				<div style="font-size: 2em">This text is 40px large, because my preset size was 20px and now i made it 2em <br><br><div style="font-size: .5em">We can also lower its size using ems, just by adding a "." before it, for example, this text, but since that text is a child of the text i just magnified, to lower it by 2ems, i have to use ".5em", because if i use 2em, i'll only return it's size to my regular 20px since that text is a parent, and is already 2em, affecting it's childs. So, here is an example of a text lowered 2ems (without previous magnifying)</div></div><br> <div style="font-size: .4em">This text is .4ems (from 20px)</div>
  		</ul>
  	</ul>

  	<p>When we specify a color, we can use "red", "blue", going for the more common ways to get a color, or we can use a hexadecimal value for a specific color (wich is the most used method) using, for example, for the same Blue color, we can use "color: blue;" or "color: #000ff;"</p>
